# Canada-Post-Challenge
This was a challenge that I had to do for a potential job opportunity with Canada Post. 
Don't worry all the data is obfuscated.

## Canada Post - Data Scientist Candidate Case Study
### Business Context:
In late 2018, the Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW) went on strike. Unfortunately, the strike fell during the busiest time of year for Canada Post, referred to as “Peak Season”. The strike affected Canada Post’s profitability and fractured relationships with some of our customers – businesses who rely on Canada Post to deliver their products. There are two reasons for the effects on Canada Post’s profitability: 1) Canada Post was not able to operate at full capacity and 2) some customers took some or all of their business elsewhere (e.g. FedEx or UPS).

The marketing department has data on parcel volumes for the previous and current years, and would like to understand the impact on Canada Post’s volumes across the three customer groups: small, medium and large customers.

### Objective
Business Question: What was the impact on Canada Post's volumes? How does it compare to prior years and how does it affect the customer groups?

#### Procedure:

- Inspected the data
- Cleaned, Transformed and Manipulated the data in order to perform analyses
- Provided Descriptive Statistics such as ranges, averages, medians, top customers, bottom customers
- Provided Visualizations such as a time series plot of the volume throughout all years and comparing the volume between years, the distributions of the data per year.
- Compared proportions of customer groups
- Found which customers had left throughout the years
- Inspected the important dates
- Performed Time Series Analysis and Forecasting
